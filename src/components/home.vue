        As an application grows, you will notice that components will share common code and state. Eventually as the application grows it can become more important to manage this state carefully, to improve maintainability, predictability and application flow.
        <br /> Vuex, is inspired by elm. It is not only a library but a state management pattern. Introducing these patterns, improves the overall application flow and creates a centralised state. However, it is easy to go overboard with state managment; thus we will look at a full range of best practices to ensure you can make the most of Vuex.
